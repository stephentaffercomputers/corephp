<p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of this website (the "Site"). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that Akimoto Ventures, LLC ("Lease Office Space", "we" or "us") gathers about you while you are using the Site and the ways in which this information is used or shared.</p>
<p><strong>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p>Because the Internet is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.</p>
<h2>What Information is Collected About Visitors?</h2>
<p>The information that is collected about you while you are using the Site falls into two general categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Site may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply while on the Site. For example, we collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and other information relevant to particular products or services that you choose to enter into one of the Site's forms. If you decline to supply or provide the Site with certain information while using the Site, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Site.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Information that is Automatically Collected</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Site also collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Site and use the Site. For example, to enhance your experience on the Site, the Site uses a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie." Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. Other examples of information that the Site may collect as you navigate it include, but are not limited to, date and time of visit, referring URL address (location from which a visitor comes to the Site), type of Internet browser, and visitor's IP address. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site.</p>
<p>Cookie data is linked to personally identifiable information for the purposes of data analysis and quality control. However, data from individual cookies will never be shared with or sold to third parties without your permission.</p>
<p>The Site uses Google Analytics to track User Sessions. This tracking does not connect any of your personally identifiable information back to Google.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Merging of Information.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Information collected through the Site may be merged with information collected from other sources, including offline sources. Similarly, information collected through the Site may be stored with information collected from other sources, including offline sources.</p>
